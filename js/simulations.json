        "moreInfo": "The ideal gas law models the rudimentary relationship between pressure, temperature, volume, and moles of gasses in a sealed container.\n\nIn this simulation, temperature is shown as the speed of the molecules, volume is the size of the container, and moles are the number of molecules. Notice how changing these values affects the visualization and the pressure."
